# Salesforce Tools
_Open-source utilities for Salesforce.com developers_

## Background
[Sales is changing](http://blog.getpattern.com/some-post), and sales operations teams must continue to innovate while meeting the demands of sales leaders: setup top of funnel flows, dedupe enriched account lists, enforce processes across global teams.

It's inevitable that sales operations personnel need validation rules, workflow rules, visualforce pages and APEX.

We think there aren't enough resources for Salesforce.com developers. Oftentimes discovering well-written, useful Salesforce materials is harder than building it yourself. Documentation is disparate. Code quality is variable. There is no go-to place for free Salesforce utilities. We got to thinking--

> Why aren't there more open-source Salesforce repos?

**We think it's hard enough to manage sales operations.** So we decided to open-source the Salesforce tools we use at [Pattern](https://www.getpattern.com). We hope this repository grows into the de facto standard for new Salesforce teams, and we encourage all Salesforce developers to contribute.
