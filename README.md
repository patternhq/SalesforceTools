# Salesforce Tools
_Open-source utilities for Salesforce.com developers_

## Background
We’re dedicated to providing tools for Salesforce developers in an ever-changing world of sales so we’ve committed to open-sourcing the majority of our Salesforce code.

Read more in our [blog post](http://medium.com/@PatternEng/link-soon).

## Use cases

In addition to Lead Utilities, we also include a basic `Mock` class for easier testing. We also recommend

- Mock test suite (smartFactory?)
- Lead Autoassign (Email Domain)
- Lead Autoconversion (Email Domain)

## Installing
1. Add this code to your sandbox environment using your favorite IDE or the web-based Developer Console. We like [MavensMate](http://mavensmate.com/).
2. Adjust as necessary based on your existing triggers (e.g. if you already have a Trigger for leads, reference the provided classes in your existing Trigger).
3. Deploy using [change sets](https://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead/en/app_deployment/app_deployment_changesets) best practices.
