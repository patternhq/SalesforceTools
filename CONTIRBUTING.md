# Contributing
SalesforceTools is a small project, and we want to encourage everyone to submit
their patches freely. To help you in that process, there are several things that
you should keep in mind.

## Style
We aim to adhere to the Style Guide set out by the [PolarisProject](https://github.com/PolarisProject/salesforceStyleGuide).

## Use Pull Requests

If you want to submit code, please use a GitHub pull request. This is _the
fastest way_ for us to evaluate your code and to merge it into the code base.
If reporting a bug, do feel free to submit snippets of code in an Issue.

## Unit Tests

Regardless of the changes you are making, please make sure that your pull
request includes appropriate unit tests.

## Testing

Along with submitting unit tests, please make sure that you have used the
built-in testing capabilities in the Force.com build system.
