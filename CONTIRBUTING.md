# Contributing
SalesforceTools is a small project, and we want to encourage everyone to submit
their patches freely. To help you in that process, there are several things that
you should keep in mind.

## Use Pull Requests

If you want to submit code, please use a GitHub pull request. This is _the
fastest way_ for us to evaluate your code and to merge it into the code base.
Please don't file an issue with snippets of code. Doing so means that we need to
manually merge the changes in and update any appropriate tests. That decreases
the likelihood that your code is going to get included in a timely manner.
Please use pull requests.

## Unit Tests

Regardless of the changes you are making, please make sure that your pull
request includes appropriate unit tests.

## Testing

Along with submitting unit tests, please make sure that you have used the
built-in testing capabilities in the Force.com build system.
